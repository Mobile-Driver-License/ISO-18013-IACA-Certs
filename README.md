# ISO-18013-IACA-Certs

A Community-Maintained Collection for IACA Certs ‚Äì ISO 18013 Compliant Mobile Driver License üåçüì≤

Currently, there is no single place to collect all IACA certificates apart from:
 üîπ DTS managed by each country

That‚Äôs why we created a community-maintained repository to collect IACA certs for ISO 18013-compliant mobile driver licenses!

This serves as a bridge to close the gap between IACAs available on the official DTS systems and direct links.

We recommend that you first obtain the IACA from the official DTS. If you are unable to find the one you are looking for, feel free to grab it.

üí° Goal: Create an open, community-driven collection of IACA certificates to support the development of verification solutions and enhance accessibility to IACA certificates.

## Navigating the Repo

ISO 3166-1 Aplha-2 is used as the source for country code identifiers and ISO_3166-2 for principal subdivisions (e.g., provinces or states) based on ISO 18013-5 7.2.8 and 7.3

The folder structure is organized as follows:

- Each country is represented by its respective country code.
- Within each country folder, state/province subfolders are included if applicable.
- If multiple providers exist, they are categorized under their respective provider names.
- All vendors and test certificates, regardless of country, are grouped under the "Miscellaneous" category.

## Official DTS Solutions:

Please first check the official DTS to see if the state is available before grabbing the IACA from this repository.

## Disclaimer

This is **NOT** a Digital Trust Service but a community-driven collection of IACA certificates. You are responsible for your own usage.  

This repository serves as a bridge to close the gap between IACAs available on the official DTS system and direct links.  

We recommend that you first obtain the IACA from the official DTS. If you are unable to find the one you are looking for, you may use the version available here.  

Unlike DTS, we **cannot** guarantee the authenticity of the IACA. While we strive to obtain them from official sources, if you are concerned about security, we strongly advise against using this repository.

**Note**: We highly recommend reaching out to specific jurisdictions or DTS service providers for the most up-to-date certificates. While we do our best to keep the certificates current, you should not rely solely on this repository.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning

The IACA available in this repository has never been independently audited!

This repository is intended to serve as a bridge, closing the gap between IACAs available on the official DTS system and direct links. While some certificates are available on DTS, not all states, countries, or provinces are covered yet. Once an IACA becomes available in the official DTS system, you should discontinue using the version in this repository for that particular state, country, or province in this repository.

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**
