# ISO-18013-IACA-Certs

A Community Maintained Public Repo of All IACA certificates.

ISO 3166-1 Aplha-2 is used as the source for country code identifiers and ISO_3166-2 for principal subdivisions (e.g., provinces or states) based on ISO 18013-5 7.2.8 and 7.3

The folder structure is organized as follows:

- Each country is represented by its respective country code.
- Within each country folder, state/province subfolders are included if applicable.
- If multiple providers exist, they are categorized under their respective provider names.
- All vendors and test certificates, regardless of country, are grouped under the "Miscellaneous" category.
